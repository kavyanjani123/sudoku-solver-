# Sudoku Solver 

The Sudoku Solver project aims to develop a C++ program that can solve Sudoku puzzles using the backtracking algorithm. The backtracking approach will systematically search for a solution by exploring possible number placements in the grid and backtracking when a conflict arises. This project will enhance understanding of recursive algorithms and constraint satisfaction problems.

## Objectives

- **Input Handling:** Create mechanisms to input Sudoku puzzles via console or file.
- **Sudoku Validation:** Implement functions to check the validity of the Sudoku grid.
- **Backtracking Algorithm:** Develop a backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzle.
- **Output:** Display the solved Sudoku grid.

 ## Features

 - **Backtracking Algorithm:** mplement a recursive backtracking algorithm that:
Iteratively tries numbers 1 through 9 in empty cells.
Checks for conflicts in the current row, column, and 3x3 subgrid.
Backtracks when a conflict is detected, undoing the last placement and trying the next possible number.

## Tools and Technologies used

- **C++**
- **backtracking**
